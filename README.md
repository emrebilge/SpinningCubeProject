# SpinningCubeProject
This is a project I have worked on about a spinning cube in 3-D. I was inspired to pursue this project after seeing several videos on it, but no one ever explaining the code.
I decided to watch these videos and think about how I can use a C program to make this work. It involved a lot of research, but I was most proud of being able to use the
Math and Physics content I learned in University to apply it to a project that I worked on.

- I used the C language to make this program, it is the most robust language for my specifications.
- A lot of linear algebra is used in matrix rotations, I am using this to spin the Cube as well as perform its visual effects.
Interestingly enough, linear algebra is a highly relevant mathematical field in the use of computer graphics.

Through completing this project, I learned more about the C programming language, and now I understand why it is not that popular of a language these days.
It also taught me a little bit more about the practices used in computer graphics, such as zbuffer.
