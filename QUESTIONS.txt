What language are you using to make this project possible?
- I'm using the C language to make this program, it is the most robust language for my specifications.




What math calculations are you solving to make the rotation of the cube possible?
- A lot of linear algebra is used in matrix rotations, I am using this to spin the Cube as well as perform its visual effects.
Interestingly enough, linear algebra is a highly relevant mathematical field in the use of computer graphics.




What is the expected date (dealine) for the project?
- I expect to finish this project within a week. I am almost done with the code, I just need to debug and tweek a few parameters.
